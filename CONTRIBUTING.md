# CONTRIBUTING

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU) on how to use Project in Github.

Basically just add card (adn convert into issue) to the project, or pick a card, you want to work on.

Go [here](https://github.com/tylim88/GameSenshi/projects) to see what you can do or what to do.

## Adding Library

If you have any library that you want to use, please discuss it with the team first, as we want to avoid using different library that do the same thing.

## Working on Code

1. Create a card and describe what you going to do.
2. In the card also specify which main module you going to modify/create.
3. Convert it into issues.
4. Start a new branch.
5. Always let others in `Discord` know what you are working on.

## Resources

Please read [wiki](https://github.com/tylim88/GameSenshi/blob/master/wiki) for details of our code, techs, guides and resources.
