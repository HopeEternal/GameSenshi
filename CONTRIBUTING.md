# CONTRIBUTING

We use Trello for task management, you can join it [here](https://trello.com/invite/b/tAyH3oig/a5374e9eaa1bbe644f3e7367d1e23300/game-senshi)!

## Working on Code

1. Create a card and describe what you are going to do, skip this if you want to work on existing task.
2. Pick a new task, edit your name into the card .
3. If you want to work on a on going task, get permission from person who is already working on it first.
4. Start a new branch or fork and start hacking.
5. Always let others in `Discord` know what you are working on.

## Adding Library

If you have any library that you want to use, please discuss it with the team first, as we want to avoid using different library that do the same thing.

## Resources

Please read [wiki](https://github.com/tylim88/GameSenshi/wiki) for details of our code, techs, guides and resources.
