# CONTRIBUTING

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU) on how to use Project in Github.

Basically just add card card to the project, or pick the cards, you want to work on.

Go [here](https://github.com/tylim88/GameSenshi/projects) to see what you can do or what to do.

## Adding Library

If you have any library that you want to use, please discuss it with the team first, as we want to avoid using different library that do the same thing.

## Working on Code

1. Create a card and describe what you going to do.
2. In the card also specify which main module you going to work on.
