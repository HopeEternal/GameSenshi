# GAME [SENSHI(æˆ¦å£«)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senshi)

A platform for gamers/streamers to provide their casual service.

## Introduction

This is a project that is designed to allow the user the ability to temporarily hire other gamers to play with them. Similar to hiring someone to work with you, this allows you the opportunity to hire another gamer to game with you. It is all about gaming companionship.

From consumer perspectives:

1. You are a big fans of a professional/famous gamer, you want to play a game with him, either as sparring partner(opponent) or team mate.
2. You are a fans of good looking or fun streamer, you want to play with her/him.
3. You are looking for game coach, gamer that systemized his knowledge and make you a better gamer.
4. You want to rank up, you need help, you need STRONK team mate!
5. Hang out with your favorite gamer/streamer, socialize!

From provider perspective:
While some gamers/streamers do make big buck, but large majority of gamers or streamers still make little or to none money out of gaming, so this platform can play a part in gaming economy as it can turn gamers into new work force.
