## Getting Started

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get the development env running.

After git clone

```bash
node install.js
```

request the `.config` folder(s) from `tylim#9831` in `Discord`

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

Direct message `tylim#9831` in `Discord` your email to become user of this firebase project.

If you skip this step you have to setup your own firebase project.

```bash
npm i -g firebase-tools
```

```bash
firebase login
```

```bash
firebase deploy
```

make sure you are in your project root directory (not firebase function directory) when you run deploy.
