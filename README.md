# GAME [SENSHI(æˆ¦å£«)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senshi)

A platform for gamers/streamers to provide their casual service and link up with others in the community.

## Introduction

This is a project that is designed to allow the user the ability to temporarily hire other gamers to play with them. Similar to hiring someone to work with you, this allows you the opportunity to hire another gamer to game with you. It is all about gaming companionship.

From the consumer perspective:

1. You are a big fan of a professional/famous gamer, and you want to play a game with him/her, either as a sparring partner(opponent), or teammate.
2. You are a fan of a streamer, and want to play with him/her.
3. You are looking for someone to help you improve as a gamer, and want a gaming "coach" that can help you along in that process.
4. You want to rank up in a specific game, but need help. You need a strong and capable teammate who has lots of experience with that game!
5. You're merely looking to hang out and socialize with streamers and/or other gamers in a relaxed environment!

From provider perspective:
While some gamers/streamers do make a lot of money, the large majority of gamers and/or streamers do not. This platform provides the opportunity for many gamers and streamers to expand their viewer base, reach new potential viewers and people to game with, and make new friends along the way! It also helps to link casual gamers up with more competitive and successful gamers/streamers, and in return helping everyone in the community grow. With this platform, we can create a new work force of gamers who are doing what they love, and making money along the way!

## Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get the development env running.

After git clone

```bash
node install.js
```

request the `.config` folder(s) from `tylim#9831` in `Discord`

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now you can start hacking on front end!

## Deployment

ðŸ›‘ Ignore this deployment section if you don't want to work with back end (firebase).

Direct message `tylim#9831` in `Discord` your email to become user of this firebase project.

If you skip this step you have to setup your own firebase project.

```bash
npm i -g firebase-tools
```

```bash
firebase login
```

above command is one time setup, anytime you want to run deploy, simply

```bash
npm run deploy
```

It will automatically inject production environment variable, build and deploy front end or back end (depending on which terminal you are in)

There is also a command to deploy on both ends:

```bash
firebase deploy
```
